Issue 1: When trying to compare two instances of the same object I was getting an error that saying it couldn't not find the element in the hashmap
I found out that the equality was failing since java compares objects by reference so even though they had the same name they were treated differently

Issue 2: When trying to use the Spring Security, I encountered an issue of spring finding the user but still unable to authenticate the user. I found out the the issue
was not a database issue but had to do with password encoder not being used with the user was authenticated.
